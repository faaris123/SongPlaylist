# SongPlaylist
This program allows a user to search through a playlist of different songs. Users can search up different songs in accordance with the year they were made, the artist that made them, and the actual title of the song. The main sort key for each of the songs will be its title. Users can also add or remove certain songs from the playlist, if they feel like changing what they are listening to. Each song will act as a node on a Red Black Tree, containing data such as the artist/artists and the year it was released. The application is based on an implementation of a Red Black Tree that will correlate the name of the song to the song values.
# Details
Data is stored in an XML file from which the data is extracted in order to fill in information about a song's name, a song's release year, and a song's artist. Afterwards, each song, along with its corresponding information, is added to an Array List which would be used in a Red Black Tree. The Red Black Tree implementation will provide the ability to manipulate the songs by either adding or removing them. The Red Black Tree will then be implemented into the Backend portion of the program, which will then be implemented into the Frontend portion of the program. The Frontend portion of the program serves as the main point of interaction between the user and the program.
# Included
I have included all of the Java files that are used to make the program work and a handful of interfaces as well.
